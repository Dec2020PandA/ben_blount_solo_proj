# Solo Project - ShakeDown
ShakeDown is an app that helps creatives get paid for their work and helps their clients pay for and access their files easily.

This app will be initially geared to provide a service to photographers. A zip file can be uploaded to the app and then a link can be sent to the customer, providing them access to the file. The second phase will be securing payment before file can be accessed by the customer. I plan on doing this through code generation, and then eventually through an integrated payment portal.
